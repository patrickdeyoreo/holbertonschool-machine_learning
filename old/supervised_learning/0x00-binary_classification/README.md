### [0. Neuron](./0-neuron.py)

Write a class `Neuron` that defines a single neuron performing binary classification:

- Class constructor: `__init__(self, nx)`:
  - `nx` is the number of input features to the neuron
    - If `nx` is not an integer, raise a `TypeError` with the exception: `nx must be an integer`
    - If `nx` is less than 1, raise a `ValueError` with the exception: `nx must be a positive integer`
  - All exceptions should be raised in the order listed above
- Public instance attributes:
  - `W`: The weights vector for the neuron. Upon instantiation, it should be initialized using a random normal distribution.
  - `b`: The bias for the neuron. Upon instantiation, it should be initialized to 0.
  - `A`: The activated output of the neuron (prediction). Upon instantiation, it should be initialized to 0.
